## **Key Takeaways**
- In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed
Python on your system if it wasn’t already there. You also installed a text edi-
tor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code
in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You
probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can
work with in your Python programs, and you’ll start to use variables as well.
